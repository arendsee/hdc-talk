The convergence of natural language and programming language is often thought of
as a goal. However, specialized languages have value.

Programming languages are not going to disappear. Both AIs and humans will want
to use them in the future.

## Scientific programming - correctness in an informal community

## AIs will want to use programming languages because:

 * performance - a general intelligence uses unnecessary resources and
   faculties to solve problems. An AGI should be able to generate a program
   smaller and more efficient than itself that solves any problem less general
   that it can solve.

 * communication - if an AI needs to share how it solved a problem, either with
   humans or other AIs, then it needs to be able to describe the process, this
   description may just be conventional code (likely very high level code).

 * safety - conventional code can be statically analyzed, proofs can be made
   about its properties. An AIs reasoning is more likely to change as it
   learns.

 * interpretability - if the AI can write code, then humans can more clearly see
   what they are doing.

 * trust - An AI cannot necessarily be trusted. They may be trained for
   nefarious purposes intentionally. They be vulnerable to adversarial
   inputs. They may make innocent mistakes in code generation that can harm a
   system. Generated code, though, can be subject to static analysis and proven
   to, for example, have no side effects. Further, the AI could be limited to a
   controlled language where all available functions are carefully curated and
   known to be reliable.

AIs are likely to use conventional programs in the future in exactly the same we
humans do currently. These programs take problems that we could painstakingly
solve ourselves but they solve it faster and in a way that is easy to share with
others. They are also less error prone and less subject to personal bias or
random mistakes than we are, in all of our fuzzy complexity.


## Humans will want to use programming languages because:

 * They can serve as a tool for thought



Therefore, programmatic libraries are important.


Programmatic libraries are important

 - perhaps as vector databases

We cannot necessarily trust AI

One solution is to have the AI generate code that can be reasoned upon by a
conventional, deterministic compiler
